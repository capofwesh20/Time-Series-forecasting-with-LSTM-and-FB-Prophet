# Time-Series-forecasting-with-LSTM-and-FB-Prophet
A time-series is a combination of observations that have been collected over time. These observations depend on the passage of time, which cannot be disregarded, thus we must analyze the data while keeping the passage of time in mind.

Time series forecasting is one of the machine learning techniques that is most frequently used in real-world applications. In order to estimate future values using past data, time-series forecasting is the statistical analysis of trends and patterns from a specific time-series of data. It belongs to the unsupervised learning category even though it is referred to as a supervised or self-supervised learning approach. Because time-series data tend to be erratic, finding patterns in them can be challenging.
